            <h1>Arnada Prasad Pattanaik</h1>
            <p>Hi! I’m Arnada, a passionate web developer dedicated to creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in building modern, responsive, and accessible websites and applications.

                My journey in web development started with a curiosity for coding and evolved into a fulfilling career. I enjoy solving problems, optimizing performance, and bringing creative designs to life. Whether it’s crafting a simple landing page or a complex web app, I’m committed to delivering high-quality, scalable solutions.
                
                Beyond coding, I love learning about new technologies and staying updated with industry trends. I believe in continuous improvement and take pride in creating work that not only meets but exceeds expectations.
                
                Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
